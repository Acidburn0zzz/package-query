package-query is a frontend to Arch Linux pacman's database - libalpm; it also
adds support of Arch User Repository - AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/).

package-query is mostly used by yaourt (https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt)
but may as well be used as a stand-alone tool.

Dependencies:
	- libalpm: https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/
	- yajl:    http://lloyd.github.io/yajl/
	- curl:    http://curl.haxx.se
